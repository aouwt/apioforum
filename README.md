# apioforum
web forum software made for some specific use cases but probably generally
usable as just a forum.

currently missing a few features and has quite a few rough edges. i would not
recommend that people use this in production, but if you did it would probably
be ok.

the "official" live instance is at <https://a.gh0.pw/>

## usage
however you prefer to deploy flask applications. `flask migrate` will set
up the database for you.

## community
irc: `#a` on [APIONET](https://apionet.gh0.pw) (or anything bridged to it).
note that this is a general discussion channel and isn't apioforum-specific.
